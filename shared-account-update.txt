🔧 Plurcast Dev Update: The Shared Test Account Saga

We just discovered this account (satoshi@nakamoto.btc) is using the well-known test key 0123456789abcdef... - a public test key anyone can use!

Instead of deleting it, we're embracing the chaos. This shared account is now the unofficial Plurcast development bulletin board. 📢

What we just tested:
✅ Multi-account credential storage (OS keyring)
✅ Account switching with `plur-creds use`
✅ Per-account posting with `--account` flag
✅ Three accounts posting successfully

The irony: We're posting about multi-account support FROM a shared account that multiple people can post to. Very decentralized. Very Nostr.
