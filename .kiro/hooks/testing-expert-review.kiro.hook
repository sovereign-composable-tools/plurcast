Analyze the codebase for test coverage gaps\n2. Review recent git changes for testing implications\n3. Identify areas that need unit tests, integration tests, or both\n4. Suggest test cases for edge cases, error conditions, and happy paths\n5. Recommend industry-standard testing practices (TDD, mocking, fixtures, etc.)\n6. Evaluate existing tests for quality and completeness\n7. Suggest improvements to test architecture and organization\n8. Consider Rust-specific testing patterns (property-based testing with proptest, doc tests, etc.)\n\nFocus areas:\n- Database operations and migrations\n- Platform integrations (Nostr, Bluesky, Mastodon)\n- CLI argument parsing and validation\n- Error handling and edge cases\n- Configuration loading and validation\n- Async/concurrent operations\n- Data serialization/deserialization\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples where helpful. Document these finds in the reports folder, maintain files when they are resolved. "
